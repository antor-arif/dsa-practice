# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

This repository contains my personal practice for data structures and algorithms using JavaScript.

## Overview

This is a collection of implementations and solutions to various data structures and algorithm problems. The goal is to strengthen my understanding of fundamental computer science concepts and improve problem-solving skills.

## Data Structures

- Arrays and Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, BST, etc.)
- Graphs
- Hash Tables
- Heaps
- Tries

## Algorithms

- Searching (Linear, Binary)
- Sorting (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, etc.)
- Recursion
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Backtracking
- Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra's, etc.)

## Problem Patterns

- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Fast & Slow Pointers
- Merge Intervals
- Cyclic Sort
- In-place Reversal of a Linked List
- Tree BFS/DFS
- Subsets
- Modified Binary Search
- Top K Elements
- K-way Merge
- Topological Sort

## How to Use

Each file is a standalone JavaScript solution to a specific problem or implementation of a data structure.

To run any solution:

```bash
node filename.js
```

For example:
```bash
node conditional.js
```

## Notes

- All implementations are done in JavaScript
- Solutions aim for readability first, then optimization
- Comments are added to explain the approach and time/space complexity
